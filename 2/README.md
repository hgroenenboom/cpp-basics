## 2. Hello World

### Actions
open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing this README file. (use the `cd` a.k.a. 'change directory' terminal command for navigation).
then run the build.sh script. This compiles a program called `main` from the `main.cpp` C++ file, and execute it.
You should see "Hello World" printed to your console window.

### Result
We have now succesfully compiled our first C++ program! 

### Example
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/cpp-basics/2
./build.sh
```

### Information
Open the `main.cpp` file and read through all the comments. They explain the bare minimum requirements to create a simple 'Hello World'
application in C++.
